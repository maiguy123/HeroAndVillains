This program allows you to keep up your favorite  MetaHuman, Teams, and Arching across the Comic multi-verse. So far, the program allows the user to create and manage Meta-human, Teams, and Arching. 

Right now, to successfully use the program; it's dependent on first creating a team. Once you've got that accomplished you can move on to adding as many teams as you'd like. Then you should be able to create arching and finally the meta-human.
